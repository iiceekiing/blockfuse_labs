| File          | Concept(s) Covered                            |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| list_01.py    | List creation, indexing, and slicing          |
| list_02.py    | String `.split()` to create lists             |
| list_03.py    | `.append()` method to add to a list           |
| list_04.py    | `.insert()` method to insert at a position    |
| list_05.py    | `.pop()` method to remove items from a list   |
| list_06.py    | Replacing items by index                      |

### 🧠 Key Concepts

- Python lists are mutable, ordered collections.
- You can use indexing and slicing to access or modify items.
- Common methods: `.append()`, `.insert()`, `.pop()`, `.split()`
- Lists are often used when handling dynamic sets of data, like user inputs, items in a game, etc.



### 🛠 How to Run

You can run each file individually:

python list_01._
