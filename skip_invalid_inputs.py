Using continue to skip invalid inputs
ðŸ§© Goal:
Ask the user to enter numbers between 1 and 10.

If the number is out of range, print "Invalid input" and skip the rest of the loop.

If it's valid, print "Accepted!".

Accept exactly 5 valid numbers (not 5 total attempts).

    if number < 1 or number > 10:
        print("Invalid input")
        continue  # Skip to the next loop iteration
    
    print("Accepted!")
    valid_entries += 1  # Only increase for valid entries
