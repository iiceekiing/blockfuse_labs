# Operating Systems (OS) — Detailed Lesson Notes

## What is an Operating System?

An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and the user. It manages hardware resources, provides a user interface, and enables the execution of application programs.

## Core Functions of an Operating System

### 1. **Process Management**
- Handles creation, scheduling, and termination of processes (running programs).
- Allocates CPU time to processes and manages multitasking.
- Ensures safe and efficient execution of multiple programs.

### 2. **Memory Management**
- Manages the computer’s RAM (Random Access Memory).
- Allocates memory to processes and reclaims it when no longer needed.
- Prevents processes from interfering with each other’s memory.

### 3. **File System Management**
- Organizes and stores files on storage devices (hard drives, SSDs).
- Provides operations to create, read, write, and delete files and directories.
- Manages file permissions and access control.

### 4. **Device Management**
- Controls and coordinates the use of hardware devices (printers, disks, network cards).
- Uses device drivers to communicate with hardware.
- Manages input/output operations and buffering.

### 5. **User Interface**
- Provides ways for users to interact with the computer.
- **CLI (Command-Line Interface):** Text-based interaction (e.g., Bash, Command Prompt).
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface):** Visual interaction (e.g., Windows, macOS desktops).

### 6. **Security and Access Control**
- Protects data and system resources from unauthorized access.
- Implements user authentication (login) and permissions.
- Provides isolation between processes for security.

## Types of Operating Systems

- **Batch Operating System:** Executes batches of jobs with minimal user interaction.
- **Time-Sharing Operating System:** Allows multiple users to use the system interactively at the same time.
- **Distributed Operating System:** Manages a group of networked computers as a single system.
- **Embedded Operating System:** Designed for specialized devices (e.g., smart TVs, cars, IoT devices).
- **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS):** Provides immediate processing for time-critical applications.

## Examples of Operating Systems

- **Windows:** Popular desktop OS by Microsoft.
- **Linux:** Open-source OS used in servers, desktops, and embedded systems.
- **macOS:** Apple’s desktop OS for Mac computers.
- **Android:** Linux-based OS for mobile devices.
- **iOS:** Apple’s OS for iPhones and iPads.
- **Unix:** Influential multiuser OS, foundation for many modern systems.

## What is Unix?

**Unix** is a powerful, multiuser, multitasking operating system developed in the 1970s at AT&T’s Bell Labs.  
It is known for its stability, portability, and simplicity.  
Many modern OSes, including Linux and macOS, are based on or inspired by Unix.

## Importance of Operating Systems

- **Resource Management:** Efficiently manages hardware and software resources.
- **User Convenience:** Provides a user-friendly interface for interaction.
- **Security:** Protects data and system integrity.
- **Application Support:** Enables running and managing application programs.
- **System Stability:** Ensures smooth and reliable operation of the computer.
