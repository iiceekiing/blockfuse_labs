- ✅ Parameters and arguments (positional, default)
- ✅ Return values and expressions
- ✅ Scope: local vs. global variables
- ✅ Writing reusable, testable functions
- ✅ Basic debugging techniques with functions

## 🧠 Why Functions Matter

Functions help break your program into **reusable**, **organized**, and **manageable** parts. Whether you're automating tasks, building web apps, or processing data — **functions are the foundation of clean code.**

## 💡 Tip for Beginners

> Start small. Build a simple function, test it, and gradually expand it. Functions will make your life 10x easier as your code grows.
