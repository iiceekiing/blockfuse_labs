# What is Control Flow in Python?
Control flow is the part of your program that decides what to do, when to do it, and how many times to do it.




# ‚ú≥Ô∏è  Basic Types of Control Flow in Python

1. Conditional Statements ‚Äî Make decisions using if, else, elif

2. Loops ‚Äî Repeat actions using for and while

3. Loop Control Statements ‚Äî Change loop behavior using break, continue, pass



## Conditional Statements ‚Äî Making Decisions

 Syntax: 

if condition:
    # do something

elif another_condition:
    # do something else

else:
    # do something if none of the above is true



# üß†  Explanation
Python checks the if condition first.

If it‚Äôs true, it runs that block and skips the rest.

If not, it checks elif (optional).

If nothing is true, it runs else (also optional).
