Awesome! Let’s begin your journey into **Python Control Flow** from the absolute basics. I’ll guide you step by step — using simple English, real examples, and explanations like you're teaching a friend.

## 🧭 What is Control Flow in Python?

**Control flow** is the part of your program that decides **what to do**, **when to do it**, and **how many times** to do it.

---

## ✳️ Basic Types of Control Flow in Python

1. **Conditional Statements** — Make decisions using `if`, `else`, `elif`
2. **Loops** — Repeat actions using `for` and `while`
3. **Loop Control Statements** — Change loop behavior using `break`, `continue`, `pass`

## 1️⃣ Conditional Statements — Making Decisions

### 🔹 Syntax

```python
if condition:
    # do something
elif another_condition:
    # do something else
else:
    # do something if none above is true
```

### 🧠 Explanation

* Python checks the `if` condition first.
* If it’s true, it runs that block and skips the rest.
* If not, it checks `elif` (optional).
* If nothing is true, it runs `else` (also optional).

### 🧪 Example:

```python
age = 18

if age < 18:
    print("You're a minor.")
elif age == 18:
    print("You just became an adult.")
else:
    print("You're an adult.")
```

## 2️⃣ Loops — Repeating Tasks

### 🔹 `for` loop

Use it when you know how many times to repeat.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

�� `range(5)` gives: `0 1 2 3 4`

### 🔹 `while` loop

Use it when you want to repeat as long as a condition is true.

```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

---

## 3️⃣ Loop Control Statements

### 🔹 `break`

Stops the loop immediately.

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
```

### 🔹 `continue`

Skips current step, moves to next loop.

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
```

### 🔹 `pass`

Does nothing, just a placeholder.

```python
for i in range(3):
    pass
```
