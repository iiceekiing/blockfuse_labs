✔ Step-by-Step Balance Updates – After every transaction, the updated balance should be stored back into the same variable (just like a real cashbook).

✔ Accuracy of Calculations – All percentages, fractions, and arithmetic operations must be calculated correctly based on the current balance at that step.

✔ Proper Code Structure and Readability – Code should be well-organized, with each transaction on a separate line, and optional comments explaining what each step represents.

✔ Correct Final Balance – The final output should reflect the exact remaining balance after all the listed transactions, proving all steps were followed correctly.
