Task 2: Airport Luggage Tracker

At Jos Airport, the luggage department tracked passengers and their luggage weights:

luggage = [("Alice", 23), ("Bob", 18), ("Charlie", 25)]

- You need to map each user to their corresponding luggage weight value.

Before the flight took off:
- A late passenger "Daisy" checked in with 20kg of luggage.
- Bobâ€™s luggage went missing.
- The staff prepared a daily report before resetting for the next flight.

# Initial luggage list
luggage = [("Alice", 23), ("Bob", 18), ("Charlie", 25)]

# Convert list of tuples to a dictionary
luggage_dict = dict(luggage)

# Take a copy of the current state for reporting
daily_report = luggage_dict.copy()

# Add Daisy's luggage
luggage_dict["Daisy"] = 20

# Remove Bob's luggage (went missing)
luggage_dict.pop("Bob")

# Print both records
print("Daily Report:", daily_report)
print("Updated Luggage after Flight:", luggage_dict)
